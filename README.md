An enterprise-grade, serverless attendance management system designed to eliminate manual tracking and provide robust, secure, and configurable attendance logic for modern businesses. This project features a cross-platform mobile app for employees and a comprehensive web dashboard for administrators.

## üåü Key Features

The system is designed with a two-role architecture: **Employee** and **Admin**.

| üîî **Real-time Notifications:** Receive updates on leave status and system announcements.                | ‚úèÔ∏è **Manual Record Correction:** Add or edit attendance records with a mandatory audit reason.              |
| üí∞ **Penalty & Violation Tracking:** Monitor personal attendance violations and any resulting penalties. | üìà **Analytics & Reporting:** Generate and view monthly reports on company-wide attendance trends.          |

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The project is built on a secure and scalable client-server architecture, with Firebase acting as the serverless backend. All business-critical logic is centralized in Firebase Cloud Functions, making the clients responsible for UI/UX while the backend handles all validation and data processing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **Flutter SDK** (v3.x or later)
- **Firebase CLI:** `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- **Vercel CLI:** `npm install -g vercel`

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repositories** (assuming separate repos for web and mobile):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-app-mobile.git
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-app-dashboard.git
    ```

2.  **Set up the Firebase Project:**

    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    - Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password method).
    - Create a **Cloud Firestore** database.
    - Enable **Cloud Storage**.
    - Upgrade your project to the **Blaze (Pay-as-you-go) plan**. This is required to use Cloud Functions, but you will not be charged as long as you stay within the generous free tier.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    - In your Firebase project settings, find your Firebase config keys for a **Web App**.
    - In the root of your `attendance-app-dashboard` project, create a `.env.local` file:
      ````dotenv
      # .env.local.example
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
      ```    - Follow the `flutterfire configure` command to set up Firebase for your Flutter project, which will generate the necessary configuration files.
      ````

4.  **Install Dependencies:**

    - For the Web Dashboard:
      ```bash
      cd attendance-app-dashboard
      npm install
      ```
    - For the Mobile App:
      ```bash
      cd attendance-app-mobile
      flutter pub get
      ```

5.  **Run the Applications:**
    - To start the Web Dashboard:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - To run the Mobile App on a connected device or emulator:
      ```bash
      flutter run
      ```

## üö¢ Deployment

- **Backend (Firebase):**

  - Deploy Cloud Functions, Firestore rules, and storage rules using the Firebase CLI from within the backend functions folder.
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

- **Web Dashboard (Vercel):**

  - The project is configured for seamless deployment on Vercel. Push your code to a GitHub repository and link it to a Vercel project. For manual deployments:
    ```bash
    vercel deploy --prod
    ```

- **Mobile App (Flutter):**

  - Build the release version and deploy it to the respective app stores.

    ```bash
    # For Android
    flutter build appbundle

    # For iOS
    flutter build ipa
    ```
